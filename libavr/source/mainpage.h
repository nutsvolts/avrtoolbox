	The central repository for the libavr library is located at:
	http://code.google.com/p/avrtoolbox/
	
	Version 001 contains the serial, ring, and usart libraries as 
	documented in Nuts&Volts June, July, and August 2011 Smiley's
	Workshop's 35, 36, and 37.
	
	<B>HOWEVER</B>, only the serial libray is documented using the avrtoolbox
	process. The ring and usart libraries will have their documentation
	made compliant in time for the July and August issues.
	
	\todo 1. Add the ATmega644.
	\todo 2. Retest with the Arduino board.
	\todo 3. Improve the comments before letting this puppy loose!
