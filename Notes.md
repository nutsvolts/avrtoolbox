**Notes on work in progress.**

December 13, 2010
I'm learning to use SVN and messed up something trying to move files from my computer to Google Code in [r9](https://code.google.com/p/avrtoolbox/source/detail?r=9) - files were put in the wrong place, I'm not sure why. But was able to correct it in [r10](https://code.google.com/p/avrtoolbox/source/detail?r=10)
